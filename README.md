my jamf school profiles and scripts to keep handy

I've provided as much detail to where I obtained these files as I can remember. I do not claim to be an expert with Jamf School, but I need a place to organize my collection of tools and scripts on my SSD.

Definitely do not copy what I'm doing with some of those scripts.
